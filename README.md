As an industrial design engineer currently pursuing a Master in Design for Emergent Futures at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia and the Fab Lab Barcelona, I am at the forefront of innovation, seamlessly integrating traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technologies. My academic journey and hands-on research at the Fab Lab leverage tools such as AI and machine learning to explore and shape the futures of design and fabrication.

The Master in Design for Emergent Futures program is a unique blend of theoretical and practical learning, focusing on four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection, and Application. This holistic approach equips me with the strategic vision and flexible skill set required to design in uncertain times, using the latest in digital fabrication, synthetic biology, and blockchain technologies. Through this program, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of how disruptive technologies can address complex systemic problems and propose innovative city-scale interventions.

My passion lies in the intersection of new technologies and arts and crafts. At the Fab Lab, I have the opportunity to experiment with and master various maker skillsâ€”from coding and digital fabrication to synthetic biology and computational thinking. This environment fosters a culture of creativity and making, where prototyping acts as a generator of knowledge and a crucial tool for problem-solving.

Furthermore, my work aligns with the philosophy of the Fab Lab network, which champions open access to tools and knowledge, promoting a collaborative and inclusive approach to innovation. This philosophy not only enhances my technical capabilities but also allows me to engage with local communities in Barcelona, applying my knowledge to human-centered design projects.

My research at the Fab Lab Barcelona focuses on futures using AI and machine learning, aiming to create sustainable and impactful design interventions. I am deeply inspired by the stories of pioneers in personal fabrication, as detailed in Neil Gershenfeld's "FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop," which underscores the transformative potential of digital fabrication technologies.

In essence, my journey as an industrial design engineer and my studies at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia and the Fab Lab Barcelona reflect a commitment to bridging the gap between traditional craftsmanship and modern technology. I am driven by a vision to design innovative solutions that respond to emerging global trends, ensuring a sustainable and equitable future for all.
