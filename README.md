As an industrial design engineer currently pursuing a Master in Design for Emergent Futures at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia and the Fab Lab Barcelona, I am at the forefront of innovation, seamlessly integrating traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technologies. My academic journey and hands-on research at the Fab Lab leverage tools such as AI and machine learning to explore and shape the futures of design and fabrication.

The Master in Design for Emergent Futures program is a unique blend of theoretical and practical learning, focusing on four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection, and Application. This holistic approach equips me with the strategic vision and flexible skill set required to design in uncertain times, using the latest in digital fabrication, synthetic biology, and blockchain technologies. Through this program, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of how disruptive technologies can address complex systemic problems and propose innovative city-scale interventions.

My passion lies in the intersection of new technologies and arts and crafts. At the Fab Lab, I have the opportunity to experiment with and master various maker skills—from coding and digital fabrication to synthetic biology and computational thinking. This environment fosters a culture of creativity and making, where prototyping acts as a generator of knowledge and a crucial tool for problem-solving.

Furthermore, my work aligns with the philosophy of the Fab Lab network, which champions open access to tools and knowledge, promoting a collaborative and inclusive approach to innovation. This philosophy not only enhances my technical capabilities but also allows me to engage with local communities in Barcelona, applying my knowledge to human-centered design projects.

My research at the Fab Lab Barcelona focuses on futures using AI and machine learning, aiming to create sustainable and impactful design interventions. I am deeply inspired by the stories of pioneers in personal fabrication, as detailed in Neil Gershenfeld's "FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop," which underscores the transformative potential of digital fabrication technologies.

In essence, my journey as an industrial design engineer and my studies at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia and the Fab Lab Barcelona reflect a commitment to bridging the gap between traditional craftsmanship and modern technology. I am driven by a vision to design innovative solutions that respond to emerging global trends, ensuring a sustainable and equitable future for all.

In 2023, the Design Factory Global Network (DFGN) issued a challenge to several international universities to innovate and create the future of Happy Meal toys. The objective was to design toys that are not only fun but also sustainable, aligning with modern environmental standards. The toys needed to adhere to sustainable design principles and serve as a "platform" adaptable to various licenses, given that Happy Meal toys are primarily based on intellectual property.

The winning proposal came from us, YU Design UPV. Our project "Trapeque" secured first place in the global challenge held in June. Trapeque features a collection of six foldable characters, each containing a unique map that can be played with in different settings, whether at a restaurant, at home, or in transit. These toys are versatile, allowing individual play or group activities where players can combine different boards to form larger maps. Each character's map depicts the birthplace of iconic artists, providing educational trivia and engaging stories.

Trapeque is designed with sustainability and simplicity at its core. The toys are crafted with minimal parts and made from renewable, recyclable materials. The main body of each toy is constructed from handmade cardboard produced from recycled cellulose fibers, ensuring the material is both durable and biodegradable. Stickers included with the toys are made from transparent, biodegradable cellulose, allowing children to decorate both the inside and outside of the toys.

The texture of the handmade cardboard evokes a connection to nature, reinforcing environmental awareness. Accessories for each character, also made from the same biodegradable materials, are interchangeable across different editions of the toy. This ensures that new and existing toys remain compatible, extending their play value and lifespan.

Trapeque represents a solution to the educational, social, and environmental needs of today’s society. It enables children to learn and play in an eco-friendly manner, offering endless possibilities for fun in various situations. Through Trapeque, children can enjoy a dynamic and enriching play experience while being mindful of their environmental impact.
