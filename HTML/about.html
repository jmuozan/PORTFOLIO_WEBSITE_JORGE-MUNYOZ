                As an Industrial Design Engineer with a foundational education from Universitat Politècnica de València and a Master's degree in Design for Emergent Futures from Fab Lab Barcelona/IaaC, I have cultivated a robust skill set in digital fabrication and prototyping. My passion lies at the intersection of traditional crafts and cutting-edge technologies, where I thrive in integrating physical computing with innovative digital tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a deep interest in the potentials of Machine Learning and AI in transforming design processes and outcomes. My experience in digital fabrication enables me to bring ideas to life with precision and creativity, while my expertise in physical computing allows me to create interactive and responsive designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am driven by a curiosity to explore how traditional craftsmanship can be reimagined in the digital age, and I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible through the fusion of analog and digital techniques. As I continue to expand my knowledge in Machine Learning and AI, I am eager to contribute to projects that harness these technologies to create innovative and impactful solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to be part of a forward-thinking team where I can leverage my skills and passions to develop pioneering designs that not only meet current needs but also anticipate future challenges and opportunities.
