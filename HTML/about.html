                As an Industrial Design Engineer with a foundational education from Universitat Politècnica de València and a Master's degree in Design for Emergent Futures from Fab Lab Barcelona/IaaC, I have cultivated a robust skill set in digital fabrication and prototyping. My passion lies at the intersection of traditional crafts and cutting-edge technologies, where I thrive in integrating physical computing with innovative digital tools.

            <p>
                I am driven by a curiosity to explore how traditional craftsmanship can be reimagined in the digital age, and I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible through the fusion of analog and digital techniques. As I continue to expand my knowledge in Machine Learning and AI, I am eager to contribute to projects that harness these technologies to create innovative and impactful solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to be part of a forward-thinking team where I can leverage my skills and passions to develop pioneering designs that not only meet current needs but also anticipate future challenges and opportunities.
